# Write your test cases!

Create inside your project folder a **spec.inout** file. Use this example as a guide:

- We want to write a code that given a certain input it will return its square, so for that exercise we can have this test cases.

File **spec.inout**:

```
//
2 #Input
//
$$
4 #Output
$$

//
3 #Input
//
$$
9 #Output
$$

#You can add more test cases if you want!
```

You can copy-paste the following example and replace it with the inputs you want to test, and their expected outputs your code will generate. Don't forget to delete the comments with the _#_ symbol.
