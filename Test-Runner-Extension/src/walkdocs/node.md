# Installing Node.js

If you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, you can installed by clicking on **Install Node.js**.

**npm (Node Package Manager)** is the default package manager for Node.js, used to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages and dependencies. When you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed along with it. So, by installing Node.js, you'll have both Node.js and npm ready to use.

To verify if it's installed, create a new terminal and try running the following command:

```node
node --version
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```node
v18.17.1
```

To check npm run the following command:

```node
npm --version
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```node
9.6.7
```

The detailed output will be based on the versions you install.
