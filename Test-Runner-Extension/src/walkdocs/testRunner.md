# Install Test Runner

Test Runner was initially developed as a command-line interface (CLI) application, providing users with a straightforward way to write code and verify its correctness based on given inputs and outputs. With these extension we create a more intuitive and seamless experience to our users.

Instead of opening our terminal and manually running command
`npm i -g uadyfmat/test-runner'`
to install dependencies, users can simply click a button **Install Test Runner** in our interface, making the setup and usage of Test Runner more efficient and user-friendly.
