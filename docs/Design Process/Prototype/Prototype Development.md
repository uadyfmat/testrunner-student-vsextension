# Prototype Development
## Description  
Prototype development is an essential part of our design to test the usability, functionality and UX in the Test Runner project. For this project we made three types of prototypes, a **Low-Fidelity Prototype**, a **Mid-Fidelity Prototype**, and a **High-Fidelity Prototype** for the following elements of the project:  
* Extension Installation.
* Extension Help Command.
* Test Results Visualization.
* Feedback Screen States.


All versions of the prototype were made using the Figma tool.

## Design Guide  
The color pallete, fonts, line spacing and some designs are shown in this section. As most of these elements are only considered in the High-Fidelity prototype, we only consider the Design Guide for said instance of the prototype.

## Prototypes

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

In this prototype the objective was to derminate the frame layout of the information that is going to be presented during the run of the functionalities.

You can access the prototype version in the following link: [Low-Fidelity Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=0%3A2&mode=design&t=PoyhKkyY1GtIc5H9-1)  


### Mid-Fidelity Prototype

To establish what was going to be included in this instance of the prototype we decided to make the low-fidelity and the high-fidelity prototypes.
This way we could take both extremes of the specific atributes and trace a middle ground between them. Therefore the elements presented don't include most of the Design Guide, like  UI color and design, and scaled font size but it does takes in consideration the placement of the information and not only in reference of the screen placement but the size of paragraph, and elements of the information.

You can access the prototype version in the following link: [Mid-Fidelity Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=164%3A2&mode=design&t=PoyhKkyY1GtIc5H9-1)

### High-Fidelity Prototype

This prototype was made after the Mid-Fidelity Prototype. In this case, it considers all te Design Guide and shows the proper use of said guide. The information now looks the closest as possible as it would in the IDE.

You can access the prototype version in the following link: [High-Fidelity Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=165%3A2&mode=design&t=PoyhKkyY1GtIc5H9-1)
