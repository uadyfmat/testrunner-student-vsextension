## Description
This section follows the Personas Methodology, answering the respective questions for each different step that the methodology presents.

## Collect Data

### Who are the users?
The users of the Test Runner application are teachers and students in the field of programming.

### How many users are there?
An average of 30 students per class group would be expected.

### What do they do with the system?
#### 1. **Teachers**:
* They create the templates for programming exercises.
* They create the respective test files that will be used to validate the correctness of the students' solutions.
* They manage the overall educational process, including setting deadlines and evaluating student submissions.
#### 2. **Students**:
* They access the exercise templates created by the teachers.
* They solve the programming exercises based on the templateâ€™s instructions.
* They upload their solutions (code) to the system for validation.
* They receive feedback on the correctness of their solutions.

## Form a Hypothesis
### What are the differences among users?
The key differences lie in their roles, responsibilities, and actions within the educational process. Teachers create and manage the content, while students interact with and complete the assignments.

## Ensure everyone accepts the hypothesis 

### **Personas: Likes/dislikes, needs, values** 

* **Likes:** 
    * Easy-to-use interface.
    * Fast and reliable code evaluation.
    * Detailed feedback on student code.
    * Ability to generate expected results for assignments.

* **Dislikes:**
    * Complex or confusing interface.
    * Slow or unreliable code evaluation.
    * Lack of detailed feedback on student code.
    * Inability to generate expected results for assignments.

* **Needs:** 
    * A tool that can help them evaluate student code quickly and efficiently.
    * A tool that can provide detailed feedback on student code.
    * A tool that can help them generate expected results for assignments.
    * A tool that is easy to use and learn.

* **Values:**
    * Accuracy
    * Efficiency
    * Feedback
    * Ease of use

### **Situations: Areas and conditions**
* **Areas:**
    * Classroom
    * Lab
    * Home

* **Conditions:**
    * Time constraints
    * Access to resources
    * Level of student expertise

### **Scenarios: Strategies and goals**
* **Scenario 1:** A teacher wants to quickly evaluate a large number of student assignments.
    * **Strategy:** Use the Test Runner application to automatically evaluate the code and generate feedback.
    * **Goal:** Save time and effort in grading assignments.

* **Scenario 2:** A student is working on a programming project and wants to check if their code is correct.
    * **Strategy:** Use the Test Runner application to run their code and compare the output to the expected results.
    * **Goal:** Identify and fix any errors in their code.

* **Scenario 3:** A teacher wants to create a programming assignment and provide students with expected results.
    * **Strategy:** Use the Test Runner application to generate expected results for the assignment.
    * **Goal:** Provide students with clear and concise instructions on what the assignment should accomplish.

## Establish a Number of Personas 

* **Does the initial grouping hold?**
    * The initial grouping of users into teachers and students is likely to hold, as these two groups have distinct needs and goals when using the Test Runner application. 
* **Are there other groups to consider?** 
    * There may be other groups to consider, such as: 
        * *Administrators:* Administrators may use the application to manage user accounts and permissions, and to track student progress. 
        * *Developers:* Developers may use the application to create and maintain the application itself. 
    * However, these groups are likely to have needs and goals that are similar to either teachers or students, so they may not need to be considered as separate groups for the purposes of persona development. 
* **Are all equally important?**
    * All groups are important, but teachers and students are likely to be the most important groups to consider when developing personas, as they are the primary users of the application. Administrators, parents, and developers may have less frequent or less direct interaction with the application, so their needs and goals may be less important to consider. 
    * However, it is important to note that the relative importance of different user groups may vary depending on the specific context and goals of the persona development process. For example, if the goal is to improve the application's user interface, then the needs and goals of all user groups, including administrators, parents, and developers, may be equally important to consider.
